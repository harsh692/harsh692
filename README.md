hi !
i am harsh. i am new to github and opencourse and really am intersted to learn all about it.
a bit about myself , i am an engineering student and a really keen appreciater of techonology.
i am mostly into everything that is fascinating to me and programming has been most intresting to me in all.
i am not an advance programmer and consider myself pretty average but it dosentt really matter to me as i am still and always be learning.
with all this said i will now begin!
